# surfs_up: Written report for the statistical analysis


## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if opening the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable all year.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
1.	Looking at the summary of the temperatures in June, the average was a perfect 75℉, which was not surprising for Hawaii.

2.	The average temperature in December was 71℉. Which is also pretty good considering other states are getting their first snow.

3.	If you take into consideration the humidity in Hawaii, on average January is the most humid. Which would make December have a high humidity as well. So that 71℉ will most likely feel closer to 80℉. The best remedy for a hot humid day is a delicious scoop of ice cream. Even if we look into the minimum temp which was 56℉, it will still feel hotter than 56℉. 


## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Hawaii gets its beautiful green scenery due to it being a volcanic islands, but also due to its rain. Luckily, as you can see from the pictures provided below, you can see that in the months of June and December it does not have a high rain.

Overall Hawaii is a great place to surf and eat ice cream. 
I believe the shop will be very successful, and in no time it will be a known spot for many locals and tourists to enjoy.
